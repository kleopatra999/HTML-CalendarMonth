HTML-CalendarMonth
-------------------

HTML::CalendarMonth is a module that simplifies the rendering of a
calendar month in HTML. It is NOT a scheduling system.

Calendars are represented as HTML::Element based structures, derived
from the HTML::ElementTable class.

The module includes support for 'week of the year' numbering, arbitrary
1st day of the week definitions, and locale support.

If you wish to use 'week of the year' numbering, or want to explore
dates beyond the capability of the internal perl time functions, then
you will need Date::Calc, DateTime, or Date::Manip.

INSTALLATION

You install HTML-Calendar, as you would install any perl module library,
by running these commands:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

DOCUMENTATION

See HTML/CalendarMonth.pm for the code. See Changes for recent changes.
POD style documentation is included in the module. This is normally
converted to a manual page and installed as part of the "make install"
process. You should also be able to use the 'perldoc' utility to extract
and read documentation from the module directly.

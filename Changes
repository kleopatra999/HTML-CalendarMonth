1.23  Sat Jun 12 21:12:45 EDT 2010
        - Updated interface with DateTime::Locale (will eventually
          require another update when Locale::CLDR is released
        - Deprecated offsets; too much complexity for little gain
        - Fixed week-of-year bug in end-of-year edge cases (first
          week has higher number than the next) RT #53795
        - Made row globbing optimize on row elements if possible
        - Updated default HTML style to be more CSS friendly (inspired
          by RT #37548)

          future) ala RT #37549

        - Improved date tool auto detect

        - Added linux 'ncal' harness

1.19  Sat Mar 15 00:47:26 EDT 2008
        - Fixed longstanding test failure due to HTML::Tree (properly)
          deciding to put quotes around numeric attributes in tags.
        - Also changed i8n test to Zulu rather than Basque since the
          DateTime::Local::eu (Basque) module no longer has
          abbreviated day names
        - Some of the DateTool modules had a minor bug in add_days() not
          checking for defined vs 0
        - I released a calendar-related module update on the Ides of
          March. I'm just sayin'.

1.18  Fri Feb 24 15:53:41 EST 2006
        - Fixed some scoping issues in DateTool/DateCalc.pm (thanks
          Carl Franks)

          (thanks Carl Franks)

1.15  Fri Apr  1 12:43:09 EST 2005
        - Split out tests
        - Version roll hopefully ironed out some cpan tester
          dependency issues

1.14  Mon Mar 28 15:32:54 EST 2005
        - forced dependency on HTML::ElementTable 1.13 or greater
        - minor brush ups

1.13  Mon Feb 28 16:02:31 EST 2005
        - Streamlined accessor/mutator logic. Uses Class::Accessor now.
        - Fixed a week of year bug introduced in the recent changes.
        - General cleanup
        - Added more tests (including one i8n test)

1.12  Mon Feb 28 00:31:16 EST 2005
        - Fixed auto-select bug that slipped through tests. :(
        - Fixed tests.

1.11  Sun Feb 27 23:58:04 EST 2005
        - No reason to reinvent the wheel. Language support has now been
          entirely replaced with full locale support as provided by
          DateTime::Locale (does not require installation of entire
          DateTime suite, if that's an issue)
        - Calendrical calculations have now been fully abstracted out to
          a back end interface. Calendars can be generated given the
          presence of any one of the following and subject to the
          circumstances of the request:

          * native Time::Local (but limited to dates between 1970 and
            2038)
          * Date::Calc
          * DateTime
          * Date::Manip
          * unix 'cal' command

1.10  Sat Feb 26 00:47:37 EST 2005
        - Added more robust language support. Currently supports en,
          de, and fr.

1.09  Tue Mar 26 05:21:59 CST 2002
        - Fixed obscure bug that caused March 31 2002
          to be dropped; related to a localtime/gmtime
          issue with DST effects.
        - Added tests for calendars over 1-year span
          plus special cases such as the aforementioned
          March 31 2002 instance.

1.08  Mon Jan  8 19:15:16 CST 2001
        - Added Date::Manip fallback from Date::Calc,
          so a C compiler is not strictly necessary
          for folks wanting week-of-year numbering
          or exotic dates.

1.07  Wed Nov  8 01:42:40 CST 2000
        - Day-of-week bug REALLY fixed. Should now work
          properly with all perumutations of calendar
          pecularities and concepts of what the first
          day of the week should be.

1.06  Wed Oct  4 13:37:31 CDT 2000
        - Day-of-week bug fixed for cases where Sunday is
          the first day of the month (such as Oct, 2000),
          or last day of the month (such as Dec, 2000),
          over various configurations of what is considered
          the first day of the week.

1.04  Sun Sep 17 12:13:40 CDT 2000
